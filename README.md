## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

For this project I created a professional portfolio website. This website contains an intro/about-me section, photos with links that go to my projects, and a contact-me section. I used the various CSS tools that we have learned during class so far in order to create this and worked on appropriate naming conventions in HTML for them to link properly.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Kindly scroll through the website and enjoy my professional portfolio. Please click any project that interests you to find out more info.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Deployed this website using GitHub pages. In order to do this I went to settings, scrolled down to GitHub pages, and selected the "master branch".
